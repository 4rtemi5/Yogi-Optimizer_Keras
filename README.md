# Yogi-Optimizer_Keras
This is an implementation of Googles Yogi-Optimizer in Keras (tf.keras)

The NeurIPS-Paper can be found here: http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8186-adaptive-methods-for-nonconvex-optimization.pdf

My implementation is heavily based on Keras own Adam implementation which can be found here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.12/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizers.py
